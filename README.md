# MorphyPOC
The implemented algorithm is a poc for the usage of the Morphy algorithm for word lemmatization. The Morphy algorithm has been developed at Princeton University, and is NOT my invention. Additionally, the project uses the nltk python module, which provides an interface to the WordNet database (also developed and maintained by Princeton University)
